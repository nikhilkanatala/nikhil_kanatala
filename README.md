## Projects

### Project - Human Activity Classification

- Description: Classify human activities based on time series data captured by a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The activities to be classified include bending, lying, cycling, walking, sitting, and standing.
  
- Technologies:
      Python: Primary programming language.
      Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
      Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
      Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
      [Any other libraries or tools you might have used, e.g., NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, etc.]

- Installation
      Clone the repository:
      git clone [Your Repository Link]
      Navigate to the project directory:
      cd [Directory Name]

      Note: Ensure you have Python installed and optionally set up a virtual environment to keep your workspace clean.

- Usage:
        Import the necessary librarires and load the data. And run the .ipynb file to understand data, view various model performance.

### Project - Breast Cancer ML Analysis

- Description: This project focuses on analyzing the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset using various machine learning methodologies. The main objective is to classify breast cancer tumors as Malignant or Benign based on nuclear cell features extracted from fine needle aspirate (FNA) images. The analysis leverages Monte Carlo simulations combined with supervised, semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to achieve robust and consistent classifications.

- Technologies:
      Python: Primary programming language.
      Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
      Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
      Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
      [Any other libraries or tools you might have used, e.g., NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, etc.]

- Installation
      Clone the repository:
      git clone [Your Repository Link]
      Navigate to the project directory:
      cd [Directory Name]

      Note: Ensure you have Python installed and optionally set up a virtual environment to keep your workspace clean.

- Usage:
        Import the necessary librarires and load the data. And run the .ipynb file to understand data, view various model performance.

### Project - Event Search

- Description: Event Search is a web application that allows users to search for events based on location, category, and distance. It is built using AngularJS, Bootstrap, and Node.js and leverages the Ticketmaster API to fetch event data. The application features an interactive data table, pagination for large result sets, a detailed event tabbed card, favoriting events, integration with Google Maps API, and direct links to the Ticketmaster website.
- Technologies: AngularJS, Bootstrap, Node.js (using Express framework), Google App Engine
- Installation: Clone the repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, and start the application with `npm start`.
- Usage: Open the application in your web browser, enter search parameters, click "Search" to retrieve events, explore the data table, view event details in the tabbed card, and utilize additional features like favoriting and venue display.
- Contributing: Contributions are welcome! This is a completely built project with potential to expand. Fork the repository, create a new branch for your changes, follow the project's coding style, and submit a pull request. Report any issues or bugs by opening an issue.
